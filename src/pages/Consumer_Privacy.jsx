                  The purpose of this California Privacy Policy is to provide
                  consumers with a comprehensive description of our LM Club’s
                  online and offline practices regarding the collecting, use,
                  disclosure, and sale of personal information and of the rights
                  of consumers regarding their personal information under the
                  CCPA.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The tables below describe how we collect, use, and disclose
                  California consumers’ personal information based on
                  definitions laid out in the CCPA. Please note that because the
                  categories of personal information collected and shared
                  largely depends on how a consumer has interacted with our
                  dealership, not all of the items listed in the tables below
                  will be relevant to you. For example, we generally only
                  collect veteran status when a consumer qualifies for a
                  military rebate. Similarly, certain pieces of information,
                  such as health and medical information, are only collected in
                  the course of administering employment benefits and claims,
                  but are not collected from customers.
